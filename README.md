# Churn Analysis Project
## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns to identify key factors influencing customer retention. Using MySQL, customer data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency. The processed data was then visualized in Tableau to uncover actionable insights through interactive dashboards, highlighting trends, high-risk customer segments, and key performance indicators. The ultimate goal is to support data-driven decision-making for improving customer retention strategies and reducing churn rates.
